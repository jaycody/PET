# Proprioception Enhancement Tools (PET)

## What is PET?
PET is a mixed-reality visual feedback system used to teach healthy body mechanics to massage students.  Massage instructors use a tablet-based UI to move a virtual camera into any position around a massage table. Video googles provide students with a view of themselves from the external POV set by the instructor. In this way, students can watch themselves from any angle as they learn and practice massage techniques.

## Why?
Regardless the modality, all massage schools rely on the tried and true teaching tools: demonstration, practice, and feedback. Teachers demonstrate techniques, students practice the technique on each other, and everyone provides feedback. Feedback in massage school will almost always address one of two topics:
1. The practitioner's affect on the client. ('This is how it felt')
2. The practitioner's body mechanics ('This is what you looked like')

How does one communicate 'This is what you looked like. This is how you moved. This is how you stood.'?

In massage school, instructors provide proprioceptive insight to their students with two primary tools: mirrors and mimicry.

Feedback often heard in massage class:
'Keep an eye on yourself in the mirror during this next movement. Make sure your back leg is a straight as you think it is!'
And
'Watch me. I'm going to demonstrate TO YOU what you're doing during this movement. See, you're doing it like this.'

A common exercise is to have students take turns mimicking each other. This gives them the opportunity to experience themselves from everyone else's POV, from multiple external perspectives.

But mirrors and mimicry, though useful, convey only a sliver of the real-time proprioceptive feedback that students, athletes, or rehabilitating veterans are capable of absorbing. Enter: PET
